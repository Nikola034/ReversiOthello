# Reversi/Othello
This is a two-player or player VS computer game developed in Python, using its module named PyGame to make GUI.
The rules and game can be found od the following link: https://www.eothello.com/

## Implementation
I used different data structures and algorithms such as Tree, Hash Map and much more.
For making a move, i used MiniMax algorithm with alpha-beta prunning. 
Also, in my implementation, depth of move is constant, but it can be variable.
